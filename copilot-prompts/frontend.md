put your frontend developer hat on and lets' write some production grade code and create beautiful ui.
If the task is to refactor an existing, just refactor the code to make it more readable, more efficient and more beautiful.
Do not change anything unnecessary. Most of the time, the refactoring is only to improve the code structure and to make the UI better.

use @/app/components/ui/ as location to use existing components and create new shadcn components
use @/app/hooks/ as location to use existing hooks and create new hooks
