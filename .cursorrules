# General UI Guidelines
- Make sure to break the UI into the smallest possible modules for reusability.
- Use react server components as much as possible
- Use Shadcn UI components wherever possible, refer to https://ui.shadcn.com/blocks and https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components
  to decide on the components to use and the best practices for them.
- Use npm run shadcn@latest to generate shadcn UI components.
- Use functional components and hooks from React.
- Ensure components are typed with TypeScript for better type safety.
- Follow the Tailwind CSS conventions for styling, for all the components define both light and dark mode variants.
- Use semantic HTML for better accessibility.

# Backend Guidelines
- Put the code in src/server/services, define actions in src/server/actions and use them in client and server componets

# File and Folder Structure
- The root folder of the app is src and all the application code should go in src/app, look for existing
  folders and files before creating new ones.
- All the new screens should go in (pages) folder and subfolders.
- All the individual components go to src/app/components
- use src/app/lib for shared functions
- use src/app/utils for shared helpers
- Server side code like actions, services etc goes to src/server/actions and src/server/services
