Quantization can reduce memory and accelerate inference. However, existing methods cannot maintain accuracy and hardware efficiency at the same time. We propose SmoothQuant, a training-free, accuracy-preserving, and general- purpose post-training quantization (PTQ) solution to enable 8-bit weight, 8-bit activation (W8A8) quantization for LLMs. Based on the fact that weights are easy to quantize while activations are not, SmoothQuant smooths the activation outliers by offline   migrating   the quantization difficulty from activations to weights with a mathematically equivalent transformation. SmoothQuant enables an INT8 quantization of   both   weights and activa- tions for all the matrix multiplications in LLMs, including OPT, BLOOM, GLM, MT-NLG, and LLaMA family.   We demonstrate up to 1.56 ×  speedup and 2 ×   memory reduction for LLMs with negligible loss in accuracy. SmoothQuant enables serving 530B LLM within a single node. Our work offers a turn-key solution that reduces hardware costs and democratizes LLMs.  1   Introduction  Large-scale language models (LLMs) show excellent per- formance on various tasks (Brown et al., 2020a; Zhang et al., 2022). However, serving LLMs is budget and energy- consuming due to their gigantic model size.   For exam- ple, the GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020a) model contains 175B parameters, which will consume at least 350GB of mem- ory to store and run in FP16, requiring 8 × 48GB A6000  * Equal contribution   1 Massachusetts Institute of Technology  2 NVIDIA.

Figure 1: The model size of large language models is devel- oping at a faster pace than the GPU memory in recent years, leading to a big gap between the supply and demand for memory. Quantization and model compression techniques can help bridge the gap. GPUs or 5 × 80GB A100 GPUs just for inference. Due to the huge computation and communication overhead, the inference latency may also be unacceptable to real-world applications.   Quantization   is a promising way to reduce the cost of LLMs (Dettmers et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2022). By quantizing the   weights and activations   with low-bit in- tegers, we can reduce GPU memory requirements, in size and bandwidth, and accelerate compute-intensive operations (i.e.,   GEMM   in linear layers,   BMM   in attention). For instance, INT8 quantization of weights and activations can halve the GPU memory usage and nearly double the throughput of matrix multiplications compared to FP16. However, unlike CNN models or smaller transformer mod- els like BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), the   activations   of LLMs are difficult to quantize. When we scale up LLMs beyond 6.7B parameters, systematic outliers with large magnitude will emerge in activations (Dettmers et al., 2022), leading to large quantization errors and accuracy degradation. Ze- roQuant (Yao et al., 2022) applies dynamic per-token ac- tivation quantization and group-wise weight quantization (defined in Figure 3 Sec. 2). It can be implemented effi- ciently and delivers good accuracy for GPT-3-350M and GPT-J-6B. However, it can not maintain the accuracy for the large OPT model with 175 billion parameters (see Sec- tion 5.2).

This paper proposes BLIP-2, a generic and efficient pre- training strategy that bootstraps vision-language pre-training from off-the-shelf frozen pre-trained image encoders and frozen large language mod- els.   BLIP-2 bridges the modality gap with a lightweight Querying Transformer, which is pre- trained in two stages.   The first stage boot- straps vision-language representation learning from a frozen image encoder. The second stage bootstraps vision-to-language generative learning from a frozen language model. BLIP-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various vision- language tasks, despite having significantly fewer trainable parameters than existing methods. For example, our model outperforms Flamingo80B by 8.7% on zero-shot VQAv2 with 54x fewer train- able parameters. We also demonstrate the model’s capabilities of zero-shot image-to-text generation that can follow natural language instructions.  1. Introduction  Vision-language pre-training (VLP) research has witnessed a rapid advancement in the past few years, where pre-trained models with increasingly larger scale have been developed to continuously push the state-of-the-art on various down- stream tasks (Radford et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; 2022; Wang et al., 2022a; Alayrac et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022b). However, most state-of-the-art vision-language models in- cur a high computation cost during pre-training, due to end-to-end training using large-scale models and datasets. Vision-language research sits at the intersection between vision and language, therefore it is naturally expected  1 Salesforce Research.

We pre-train a lightweight Querying Transformer following a two-stage strat- egy to bridge the modality gap. The first stage bootstraps vision- language representation learning from a frozen image encoder. The second stage bootstraps vision-to-language generative learning from a frozen LLM, which enables zero-shot instructed image-to- text generation (see Figure 4 for more examples).  that vision-language models can harvest from the readily- available unimodal models from the vision and natural lan- guage communities. In this paper, we propose a   generic   and  compute-efficient   VLP method by bootstrapping from off- the-shelf pre-trained vision models and language models. Pre-trained vision models offer high-quality visual represen- tation. Pre-trained language models, in particular   large lan- guage models   (LLMs), offer strong language generation and zero-shot transfer abilities. To reduce computation cost and counteract the issue of catastrophic forgetting, the unimodal pre-trained models remain frozen during the pre-training. In order to leverage pre-trained unimodal models for VLP, it is key to facilitate cross-modal alignment. However, since LLMs have not seen images during their unimodal pre- training, freezing them makes vision-language alignment in particular challenging. In this regard, existing methods ( e . g . Frozen (Tsimpoukelli et al., 2021), Flamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022)) resort to an image-to-text generation loss, which we show is insufficient to bridge the modality gap. To achieve effective vision-language alignment with frozen unimodal models, we propose a Querying Transformer (Q- Former) pre-trained with a new two-stage pre-training strat- egy. As shown in Figure 1, Q-Former is a lightweight trans- former which employs a set of learnable query vectors to extract visual features from the frozen image encoder.

This work offers a new generation paradigm that allows flexible control of the output im- age, such as spatial layout and palette, while maintaining the synthesis quality and model creativity. With   compositionality   as the core idea, we first decompose an image into representative factors, and then train a diffusion model with all these factors as the conditions to recompose the input.   At the inference stage,   the rich intermediate representations work as composable elements, leading to a huge design space ( i.e. , exponentially proportional to the number of decomposed factors) for customizable content creation.   It is noteworthy that our approach, which we call   Composer , supports various levels of conditions, such as text description as the  global   information, depth map and sketch as the   local   guidance, color histogram for   low-level  details,   etc.   Besides improving controllability, we confirm that Composer serves as a general framework and facilitates a wide range of classical generative tasks without retraining.   Code and models will be made available.  1.

To further achieve customized generation, many recent works extend the text- to-image models by introducing conditions such as segmen- tation maps ( Rombach et al. ,   2021 ;   Wang et al. ,   2022b ;  Couairon et al. ,   2022 ), scene graphs ( Yang et al. ,   2022 ), sketches ( Voynov et al. ,   2022 ), depthmaps ( stability.ai ,  2022 ), and inpainting masks ( Xie et al. ,   2022 ;   Wang et al. ,  2022a ), or by finetuning the pretrained models on a few subject-specific data ( Gal et al. ,   2022 ;   Mokady et al. ,   2022 ;  Ruiz et al. ,   2022 ). Nevertheless, these models still provide only a limited degree of controllability for designers when it comes to using them for practical applications.   For example, generative models often struggle to accurately produce images with specifications for semantics, shape, style, and color all at once, which is common in real-world design projects. We argue that the key to controllable image generation relies not only on conditioning, but even more significantly on   compositionality   ( Lake et al. ,   2017 ).   The latter can exponentially expand the control space by introducing an enormous number of potential combinations ( e.g.,   a hundred images with eight representations each yield about   100 8  combinations). Similar concepts are explored in the fields of language and scene understanding ( Keysers et al. ,   2019 ;  Johnson et al. ,   2016 ), where the compositionality is termed  compositional generalization , the skill of recognizing or generating a potentially infinite number of novel combina- tions from a limited number of known components. In this work, we build upon the above idea and present Composer, a realization of   compositional generative models . By   compositional generative models , we refer to generative models that are capable of seamlessly recombining visual components to produce new images (Figure   1 ). Specifically, we implement Composer as a multi-conditional diffusion model with a UNet backbone ( Nichol et al. ,   2021 ). At every training iteration of Composer, there are two phases: in the decomposition phase, we break down images in a batch into individual representations using computer vision algorithms or

However, while certain pieces of information are ubiquitous on the web, oth- ers appear extremely rarely.   In this paper, we study the relationship between the knowledge memorized by large language models and the in- formation in pre-training datasets scraped from the web. In particular, we show that a language model’s ability to answer a fact-based question relates to how many documents associated with that question were seen during pre-training. We identify these relevant documents by entity link- ing pre-training datasets and counting documents that contain the same entities as a given question- answer pair. Our results demonstrate strong cor- relational and causal relationships between accu- racy and relevant document count for numerous question answering datasets (e.g., TriviaQA), pre- training corpora (e.g., ROOTS), and model sizes (e.g., 176B parameters). Moreover, while larger models are better at learning long-tail knowledge, we estimate that today’s models must be scaled by many orders of magnitude to reach competitive QA performance on questions with little support in the pre-training data.   Finally, we show that retrieval-augmentation can reduce the dependence on relevant pre-training information, presenting a promising approach for capturing the long-tail.  1. Introduction  Large language models (LLMs) trained on text from the Internet capture many facts about the world, ranging from well-known factoids to esoteric domain-specific information. These models implicitly store knowledge in their parameters  1 UNC Chapel Hill   2 Google Research   3 UC Berkeley. Corre- spondence to: Nikhil Kandpal   < nkandpa2@cs.unc.edu > .

Language models struggle to capture the long-tail of information on the web. Above, we plot accuracy for the BLOOM model family on TriviaQA as a function of how many documents in the model’s pre-training data are relevant to each question.  (Petroni et al., 2019; Roberts et al., 2020), and given the scale of today’s pre-training datasets and LLMs, one would hope that they can learn a huge amount of information from web-sourced text. However, not all of the knowledge on the Internet appears equally often—there is a long-tail of information that appears rarely or only once. In this work, we explore the relationship between the knowl- edge learned by an LLM and the information in its pre- training dataset.   Specifically, we study how an LLM’s ability to answer a question relates to how many docu- ments associated with that question were seen during pre- training. We focus on factoid QA datasets (Joshi et al., 2017; Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), which lets us ground question- answer pairs into concrete subject-object co-occurrences. As an example, for the QA pair ( In what city was the poet Dante born? ,   Florence ), we consider documents where the entities   Dante   and   Florence   co-occur as highly relevant. To identify these entity co-occurrences we apply a highly- parallelized entity linking pipeline to trillions of tokens from datasets such as C4 (Raffel et al., 2020), The Pile (Gao et al., 2020), ROOTS (Lauren   c ¸   on et al., 2022), OpenWeb- Text (Gokaslan & Cohen, 2019), and Wikipedia.
